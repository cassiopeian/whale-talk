# whale-talk
 
Like Google Translate, but significantly less useful. Use Whale Talk to translate text into whale language. Take a phrase like "turpentine and turtles" and translate it into its whale talk equivalent: <i>UUEEIEEAUUEE</i>.

There are a few simple rules for translating text to whale language:
<br>» There are no consonants; only vowels excluding <i>y</i>.
<br>» The <i>u</i>'s and <i>e</i>'s are extra long, so we must double them in our program.
